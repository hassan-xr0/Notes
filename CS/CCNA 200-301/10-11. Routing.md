## What is Routing
- Routing is a process which determines path of IP packet to reach the destination
- Routing is done with help of route
- router store routes in route table (just like [[CS/CCNA 200-301/5-6.Ethernet LAN Switchinh.md#^SvdRj695|MAC Address Table]] in switches)
- A route is the  path where data travels

There are two methods of Routing
1. Dynamic Routing :
In this router use dynamic routing protocols (OSPF) to automatically build their Routes table
2. Static Routing  
In this a Network engineer or admin manually configure the routes on router

# Routing

so here if we see above are codes and below are are routes

When we configure an IP on an interface and start it with `no shutdown` these to routes are automatically added. So in above picture they configured 3 interface so there are total 6 route
##### L - Local : 
- A route to the actual IP address configured on the interface (with a 0/32 mask)
- It the literal IP of the interface 
- Its the IP that we configured on router
- Well its a router but 1/32 means all bit are fixed 
##### C - connected : 
- A route to the network that interface is connected to (not one route all the route of the network)
- Interface address R1 G0/1= **192.168.9.***1/24*
- Network address = **192.168.9.***0/24*


### Route selection
Now If router receives packet with destination IP of 192.168.1.0/24 so what will happen? router will chose the more specific rout because both connected route and local router are matching. For example the route to 192.168.1.0/24 have 256 different IP but The route to 192.168.1.1/32 have 1 IP so it will chose it![[Pasted image 20250901165108.png]]

## Static Routing
In Static Routing router chooses the route that are configure by us. For example in above diagram if PC1 want to send data to PC4 It cannot send because R1 only has it own Route (0/32) and Network Route (192.168.1.0/24,192.168.13.0/24) but PC4 is in 192.168.4.0/24 network so we configure routes on Router by telling the destination (PC4) and Route to that network(R3->R4)
