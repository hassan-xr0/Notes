## Cisco CLI
It is a OS built by cisco like window or Linux but only cmd. It is used to configure cisco devices
- we can conect to cisco device by USB mini or RJ45![[Pasted image 20250807185445.png]]
- For RJ45 port we will use a rollover cable which one side is rj45 and other is VGA port
- Putty is used for Terminal emulator
- there are tow modes in Cisco cli 
- User EXEC Mode : this is by default and we not write just read `hostname>`
- Privileged EXEC Mode : this is like sudo
- there ae two config file one is there current one called `running-config` other is start-up file `startup-config`
