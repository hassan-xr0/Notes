#### 1. Layer 1 (physical)
It defines characteristic of medium for transferring data between devices (voltage, cables, connector).Bits converted to electrical signals
#### 2. Layer 2 (Data Link)
It node-to node connectivity (pc to switch).Define how data formatted. Detects and correct layer 1 error. Use addressing different form layer 3


## TCP/IP Suite
TCP IP suite is a conceptual model made by DARPA. In industry if some1 tell that the error occurs in layer 4 model then it will be the layer of OSI model not TCP/IP} suite
