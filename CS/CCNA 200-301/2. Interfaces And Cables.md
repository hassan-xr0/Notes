### Copper UTP Cables
- they send electrical signal 
-  RJ 45 cable is use for ethernet
- RJ 45 cables have 8 wire  that connect 8 pins and transfer  and receive data
- these are RJ-45 Ports

- Ethernet : collection of network protocols
- Network protocols are common language between net devices
- data is sent in bits and byte over network in cables or wireless 
- speed of data is measured in bits (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps) not in byte per second
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- 1 kilobit = 1,000 bits
- Add 3 zero (000) after every time you go up in speed or bit for example Megabits = 1,000,**000** bits
- these are Ethernet standards provided by IEEE .  here in informal name ***T*** refers to twisted pair![[Pasted image 20250805185249.png]]

- Ethernet copper cables are UTP cables (unshielded twisted pair)
#### 10BASE-T 100BASE-T
- For this we use straight through cable![[Pasted image 20250805190854.png]]
- These ae crossover cable which use to connect when both receiving and sending device is same because for instance if we have 2 router then they will both receive at same pins and transmit  but 1 end of pin should receive and transmit so we use crossover cable![[Pasted image 20250805191818.png]]
- `10BASE-T and 100BASE-T `Router, PC, Firewall  Transmit data at pin 1 & 2 , receive data at pin 3 & 6
- On the other hand Switches Transmit at 3&6 and receive at 1&2
- In modern Switches we don't need worry about these because they have Auto MDI-X they automatically adjust the pins

#### 1000BASE-T 10GBASE-T
- In this all pins are used so its bidirectional

### Fiber - Optics :
They have two cables one for receiving and other for transmitting. Data travel in the form of light. There are two type of these![[Pasted image 20250805201945.png]]
