## Version field 
- length 4 bits
- identifies the version of IP
- IPv4 = 4 (0100)
- IPv6 = 6 (0110)
## Internet Header Length(IHL)

- Length 4 bits
- Identify the full length of header in 4-byte increment 
- **Example :** if value is 5 = 5 x 4 = 20 bytes
- Minimum value = 5 
- Max value 15 (15 x 20 = 60-bytes) because if all 4 bits are 1 then it become 15[^1]
- MIN LENGTH OF IPv4 HEADER = 20 bytes
- MAX LENGTH OF IPv4 HEADER = 60 bytes

## DSCP field 
- Stands for *Differential Service Code Point*
- Lengths = 6 bits
- Used for QoS (Quality of Service) 
- Used to prioritize delay sensitive data 
- Means prioritize data that cannot be delay like streaming video or voice 

> [!NOTE] 
> We will learn about QoS in future
