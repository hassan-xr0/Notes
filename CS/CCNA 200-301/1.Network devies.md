- server : any device that can send data .
- client : any device that can receive data .Previously server can also become client when it receive data
- in networking cloud icon is use for internet or where the info about network is not important(irrelevant network)

# Switches :

- Have  24+ ports ( network interfaces) 
- Only in a LAN.
- It cannot connect one LAN network to another  

**Example :** Cisco Catalyst 9200, Catalyst 3650 these are cisco enterprise based switches

*For instance we have two branches of company they both have switches but it cannot communicate with each other over aa network or internet it is only LAN*

# Router:
